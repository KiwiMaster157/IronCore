This file explains how Objects are formed from Nodes.

1. Objects are consecutive Nodes in the simulation layout.
   They consist of 5 different parts.
   a. Callback function.
      This position doubles as the position of the Object.
      (1). Function pointer.
   b. Control block. Fixed size.
	  Contains metadata about the Object's memory.
	  (1). Offset of Internals.
	  (2). Offset of Inputs.
	  (3). Offset of Outputs.
	  (4). Total size of Object.
	  (5). Total size of previous Object.
   c. Argument block. Variable size.
      Contains arguments set by the user.
	  (1..n). Values of Arguments.
   d. Internal block. Variable size.
      Contains signals and numbers stored inside the Object.
	  (1..n). Values of Internals.
   e. Inputs block. Variable size.
      Contains the values of signals coming into the Object.
	  (1..n). Values of Inputs.
   f. Outputs block. Variable size.
      Contains pairs of positions (relative to Beginning).
	  The first is the position of the Object receiving the signal.
	  The second is the position of the Input receiving the signal.

The specific layout of Objects should ALWAYS be hidden behind an API wall.
